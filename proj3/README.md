# BearMap

My job for this project is to implement the back end of a web server. To use your program, a user will open an html file in their web browser that displays a map of the city of Berkeley, and the interface will support scrolling, zooming, and route finding (similar to Google Maps).

## Parts of this Project
* **Map Rastering**: Given coordinates of a rectangular region of the world and the size of the web browser window, provide images of the appropriate resolution that cover that region.

* **Data Structures**: Implementing a -d tree and extending the MinHeapPQ to be used in Part Routing.

* **Routing**: Given a start and destination latitude and longitude, provide street directions between those points.
