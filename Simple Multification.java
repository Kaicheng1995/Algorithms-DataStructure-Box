Above link shows the Big-O notation value of simple multification. For each input "N", we have mostly "2N" operations in every 
Line, and "N" lines in every rows. Also notice that the last step is to add all the results, but here the operations are only 
constant. Thus, the Big-O of simple multification is "NÂ²".

(Note: One operation sometimes can be calculated wrongly because of personal habits)
