# NBody Simulation

The goal for this project is to write a program simulating the motion of N objects in a plane, accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
StdDraw, StdOut
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Null
```

And repeat

```
Null
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
